My term project is inspired by Scracth from MIT (scratch.mit.edu). I'm building a programming language "Avacado" (which stands for everyone can code). There are mainly three parts on the screen -- the scripts, the control, and the display. Users can drag the functions/operators /other stuff from scripts to the control board to make the object on the display screen move. The programming languages like "for loop" are simplified in this program so that everyone can understand and learn how to create their own program by this. I'm only using Tkinter.
